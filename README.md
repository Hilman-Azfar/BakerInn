# BakeInn

## Concept Design

The baking/cooking community in Singapore does not have a common space to express their interest, socialize, share ideas and have a convenient location to share common sought items. Even though there are group in community centres, facebook groups and SMEs that cater to the niche community, there is not a platform which caters to all their needs.
